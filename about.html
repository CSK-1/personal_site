                <p> 
                    Outside of being a life-long learner, I also appreciate the personal growth that comes from pushing myself physically. I love weightlifting, cycling, running, and climbing. I also enjoy more calming and centering modes of exercise, like yoga and walking outside.
                    <br>
                    Whether its reaching for a new lifting PR or trying to land new yoga poses, I look forward to joyful movement.

            <h3 class="aboutH3">Creating Art</h3>
            <p>
                I've always self-identified as an artist and a creative. I feel an inate drive to express myself - whether thats through more traditional art mediums like painting and photography, or mediums that lean more craft-focused like knitting and making things with my Cricut cutting machine.
                <br>
                I love picking up new creative outlets -- my most recent accomplishment being making two large format rugs via a process called punch needling. It took several months, but was well worth it.

            <h3 class="aboutH3">Fostering Community</h3>
            <p>
                Maybe it is the extrovert in me, but I find fostering community and making and introducing new friends is a very important and fulfilling part of my life. I love attending meetups, whether for encouraging joyful movement or creating crafts together. Once I have graduated my coding bootcamp, I look forward to attending even more meaningful meetups!
                <br>
                I also occasionally volunteer with an organization called Hope for the Day, that works to connect me directly with people to talk about mental health and the importance of checking in with our loved ones.
